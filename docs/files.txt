== Output directories

The 16-bit Delphi 1.0 project is configured to write its output files to a 
directory called "output" under the source code directory, so we
have included a directory called "output" in the source code
installation package. The 32-bit Delphi 2.0 project expects a 
directory called "output20". We suggest you leave both directories
around unless you are sure you won't be using the other version
of Delphi.

== Programmer's Guide

The programmer's guide describing each source code file
is called gwiprog.txt (in the docs directory).
